//Q1 

Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle using the formula A = (b * h) / 2. 
The program should prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle
 and then display the calculated area?




  double base, height, area;
  stdout.write("Enter the base of the triangle: ");
  base = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

  stdout.write("Enter the height of the triangle: ");
  height = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

  area = (base * height) / 2;
  print("The area of the triangle is $area");


//Q2  

Write a program that prompts the user to enter 
two floating-point numbers and then calculates their average. 
The program should display the result with two decimal places?

  double num1, num2, average;
  stdout.write("Enter the first number: ");
  num1 = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

  stdout.write("Enter the second number: ");
  num2 = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

  average = (num1 + num2) / 2;
  print("The average of $num1 and $num2 is ${average.toStringAsFixed(2)}");



//Q3

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a radius and then calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere.
 The formulas for volume and surface area are V = (4/3) * pi * r^3 and A = 4 * pi * r^2, respectively?

  double radius, volume, surfaceArea;
  stdout.write("Enter the radius of the sphere: ");
  radius = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
  volume = (4 / 3) * pi * pow(radius, 3);
  surfaceArea = 4 * pi * pow(radius, 2);
  print("The volume of the sphere is $volume");
  print("The surface area of the sphere is $surfaceArea");

//Q4 

  Write a program that prompts the user to enter a base and an 
exponent and then calculates the result of raising the base to the exponent. 
For example, if the user enters 2 and 3, the program should calculate 2^3 = 8?

  {
    int base, exponent, result = 1;
    stdout.write("Enter the base: ");
    base = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

    stdout.write("Enter the exponent: ");
    exponent = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);

    for (int i = 1; i <= exponent; i++) {
      result *= base;
    }
    print("$base raised to the power of $exponent is $result");



//Q5

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and then converts it to Fahrenheit.
 The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = (9/5) * C + 32?

    double celsius, fahrenheit;
    stdout.write("Enter the temperature in Celsius: ");
    celsius = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
    fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32;
    print("$celsius Celsius is $fahrenheit Fahrenheit");

//Q6

CHALLENGE QUESTION: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and then determines whether it is a prime number. 
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself?


    int num;
    stdout.write("Enter a positive integer: ");
    num = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
    bool isPrime = true;
    for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
      if (num % i == 0) {
        isPrime = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (num == 1) {
      print("$num is not a prime number");
    } else if (isPrime) {
      print("$num is a prime number");
    } else {
      print("$num is not a prime number");
    }
  }
}
